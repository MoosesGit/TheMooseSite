      <h1>Failure Is an Attempt ❌</h1>

      <p>We live in a world where people treat failure like something shameful. One rejection, one mistake, one missed opportunity, and suddenly people start doubting themselves. I believe that failure is not something to be ashamed of. Failure is proof that you are trying. Failure is a sign that you are working toward something that actually matters.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Failure</h2>
      <p>Failure is not the end, unless you allow it. Failure is part of the process. Every failure is a sign that you've taken that step, trying to build something bigger than yourself. The real failure is sitting around, wishing you had taken that chance.</p>
      <p>When you are chasing something real, expect to struggle, even look forward to it. If you are doing anything worthwhile, you are going to get knocked down. You are going to lose. You are going to struggle. That is normal. That is necessary.</p>

      <h2>Eating Dirt and Dragging Yourself Through the Mud</h2>
      <p>Sometimes moving forward means eating dirt. It means dragging yourself through the mud when you are tired, frustrated, and questioning whether any of it is even worth it. It means taking another rejection email after another, and still getting up the next morning ready to do it all over again. It means building a project that fails on the first, second, fifth, and tenth attempt, but refusing to walk away.</p>
      <p>Everybody loves winning. Everybody loves the highlight reel. But the truth is, progress is made in the dirt. Progress is made when you are willing to show up dirty, tired, frustrated, and keep pushing anyway.</p>

      <h2>The Power of Showing Up</h2>
      <p>Most people will never even try. They will criticize from the outside looking in. Just by trying, even if you fall flat on your face, you are already ahead of most people.</p>
      <p>There are no easy roads. No shortcuts. No hacks. There is only work. You move through the rejections, the failures, the long stretches of doubt. You move through the mud, and you come out stronger on the other side.</p>

      <h2>Every Attempt Matters</h2>
      <p>Every attempt counts. Every failure sharpens you. Every mistake strengthens you. Even when you cannot see the results right away, even when it feels like you are stuck, every effort is building something inside of you that nobody can take away.</p>
      <p>One rejected job does not define you. One bad project does not define you. One broken opportunity does not define you. These are just chapters, not the whole story. You are still writing it.</p>

      <h2>The Mindset Shift</h2>
      <p>Words like "failure" only carry the weight you allow them to carry. I do not let failure drag me down. When something does not go the way I planned, I see it for what it is: another attempt. Another step forward. Another chance to grow and be better.</p>
      <p>I believe that is the difference between the people who make it and the people who stay stuck. The ones who move forward are the ones who refuse to quit when it gets ugly.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>If you are struggling, doubting yourself, feeling like you are falling short, that is good. That means you are still trying. That means you are doing something that matters.</p>
      <p>Drag yourself through the mud if you have to. Eat the dirt if you have to. But do not quit. Every success story you admire was built on failure after failure that nobody saw.</p>
      <p>Failure is not the enemy. Quitting is. Keep Working. You'll get through it</p>
